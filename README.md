# ParallaxRecyclerView
This library will provide you to have Parallax effect on every item of your RecyclerView. 
Sample shows with static images but it can be used with async loading images as well. 
Tested with [Picasso][1]

Compatibility
-------------
This library works on 2.2+ probably earlier as well, but i didn't even bother to test because i believe at some point we have to stop supporting every version ;)

Usage
-----
Get your ParallaxRecyclerView instance, and set its adapter as shown in sample. You need to provide a ParallaxImageView, which will handle parallax effect, on your recyclerView's item. 

In your adapter create a ViewHolder which extends ParallaxViewHolder. This will make you implement below method that you need to return your ParallaxImageView's id on item.

```java 
@Override
public int getParallaxImageId() {
    return R.id.backgroundImage;
}
``` 

And this method needs to be called onBindViewHolder method to notify ParallaxImageView that will be displayed once again, so it will re-center itselfs.

```java 
viewHolder.getBackgroundImage().reuse();
```

If you wish to change Parallax effects ratio, you can simple call `setParallaxRatio` on code, or you can set it by xml with `parallax_ratio` attribute.

References
----------

This library has been built by our designer's insistence. She's seen [JBParallaxCell library on IOS][2] and want it to have in Android as well. Researches lead me to [this repository][3] but it wasn't quite affective as it is on IOS, so here ParallaxRecyclerView.
